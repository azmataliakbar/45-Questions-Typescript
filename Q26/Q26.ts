• If the alien’s color is green, print a statement that the player just earned 5 points for shooting the alien.

• If the alien’s color isn’t green, print a statement that the player just earned 10 points.

• Write one version of this program that runs the if block and another that runs the else block.

// Version that runs the if block

    console.log("\nCongratulations! You just earned 5 points for shooting the green alien.");
} else {
    console.log("\nCongratulations! You just earned 10 points for shooting an alien that is not green.");
